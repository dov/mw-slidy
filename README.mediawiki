== Introduction ==

mw-slidy provides a system for creating a [[http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/Overview.html#%281%29 HTML-slidy slideshow]] as a MediaWiki extension. The code is based on the [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:BR/use_S5_slide_system_in_the_mediawiki/en S5 slide system in MediaWiki]] extension.

== Usage ==

In the beginning of the page to be used for a slidy show, simply add the text

  <slidy/>

this will add a right-aligned label when viewed as a normal mediawiki page. When the label is pressed, a new html is opened that shows the contents as a HTML slidy slide show.

Each level 2 mediawiki title is converted into a new slide.

== Themes ==

To change the default theme, use the "theme keyword". E.g. to use the w3c theme, add:

  <slidy
  theme="w3c" />

== Building your own theme ==

Themes are available in the <tt>themes/</tt> sub directory. To create your own theme, simply copy one of the existing themes, and change the CSS to your fancies.

== Asking for contributions ==

*Please* send me your modified themes, and I will be happy to include them into future versions!
